# What I've learned at jsday 2016 in Verona

I had the chance to participate to [jsday](http://2016.jsday.it/) in Verona early this year and I wanted to make a small summary to all of you that couldn't be there. I really liked [Kitze](https://medium.com/@kitze/lessons-learned-at-react-amsterdam-51f2006c4a59#.leg4e0mjn)'s' idea to write about React Amsterdam conference he attended.

Unfortunately this summary can't be complete since there were 2 distinct tracks and I couldn't follow both of them at the same time but still, I hope this can be interesting for you anyway.

I'll add slides and videos links as soon as they are available.

##TL;DR
The big topic was *Functional reactive programming*, or RxJs if you prefer.
That seems like the big thing in javascript 2016.

2 talks, a workshop and mentions in many talks, all about *Functional reactive programming*.

# Day 1
## First Keynote: What we need from the Web, and what it needs from us.
[@shwetank](https://twitter.com/shwetank), Opera developer, talked about *Progressive web apps*, probably the second big thing in javascript 2016. It was fun because I just attended another great conference at google Italia few days before the jsday on the exactly same topic. I was thinking *PWA* were a Google mostly-only thing but I was happy to realize other browsers thinking about it as a way to save `the web` against `mobile native` development.

How *PWA* can beat native?
Basically web offer: `try before install` model vs native that force you to install an app to try it.

Pretty much same capabilities and user engagement without even the needs of installing.

 - Add to home screen
 - Work offline
 - Push notifications
 - Plus the web's power: different urls, SEO, accessibility...

With *PWA* you let the user choose and that for @shwetank can be the key.

## Functional Programming and Async Programming Workshop
The topic was tempting but then after a tiny, and I need to say interesting, introduction from [@mattpodwysocki](https://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki) people lost the interest.

Everybody was following the exercise from the reactivex [site](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/), that I really encourage you to take but maybe at your place since there wasn't any pro to be there staring at your computer.

It isn't a critic to him or to the organization but a remind to myself: don't be tempted by workshops next year.

Anyway presentation's slide can be found [here](https://github.com/mattpodwysocki/jsday-workshop-2016) along with all the other informations and I encourage you to check them out.

## Forgotten funky functions
[@jakobmattsson](https://twitter.com/jakobmattsson) give a quick talk about javascript in general and what you can easily accomplish with function that you may even forgot. In javascript everything is so simple, but it has great things.
3 main topics:
 - functional programming
 - meta programming
 - there is no class

> Whenever you have a problem you can solve it with another function.

He talked about `apply`, `call`, `clojures`, `eval`. Subjects that (almost) every js developer has doubt on when he needs to play with.

He concluded with an useful explanation on ES6 or coffeescript classes syntactic sugar that you may not need if you first fully understand **Object.create**.

## Functional Reactive programming with React.js
**Spoiler alert**, [@lucamezzalira](https://twitter.com/lucamezzalira) didn't talk about react at all! At the end he talked about cycle.js but it was a good *excursus* about RxJs.

You have to start learning few concepts to understand reactive programming, like *streams*, [cold and hot observables](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) and [operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html).

If you are using a *Flux* implementation for your front end architecture or even worst MVC / MVVM / MV* pattern, you are living in the past! Say hello to **MVI** aka [Model View Intent](http://thenewstack.io/developers-need-know-mvi-model-view-intent/).

I'm personal quite happy with *Redux* at the moment but I think you need at least know what's going on around you.

The conclusion was that *Functional Reactive programming* isn't always the best thing to do but for sure it's great when you need to fetch lots of data and react.

## Out of the browser and onto the streets
[@Rumyra](https://twitter.com/Rumyra) did the most pleasant talk of the day, with music and visual, it was party time already!

Apparently she's [VJing](https://github.com/Rumyra/VJing) around projecting visual animations on buildings along with loud music. I'd love to see her in action. Unfortunately she haven't had the chance to do it during the party in Verona, but maybe next year ðŸ˜€.

I'm sure if you are into visualization and audio you have loved this.

She talks about the newest web APIs such as `animation`, `audio`, `strem` and `midi`. I encourage you to have a look at her [github](https://github.com/Rumyra) account. It's not that easy to find samples but you can have an idea about her projects.

She showed us a demo with voice control from the microphone and then mixing music, video and visual animation.

Last she ended up showing her hand made bag she's usign for VJing with a mac in it and her "mini" MIDI controller.
