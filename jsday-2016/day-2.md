# Day 2 (follow up from [day 1](./day-1.md))

## Keynote: Shipping one of the largest Microsoft JavaScript applications (Visual Studio Code's story)
Alexandru Dima is a Microsoft developer in the VS Code team and he did a very great talk about the story of their product.

It was really helpful to understand at least why Microsoft didn't just fork (and contribute on) *Atom editor* but they choose to create another editor with same technology.

Basically they started in 2014 working on it using `node-webkit` as a platform switching to `electron` later on.
He talked about the roadmap they had, early preview in April, beta in November 2015 and 1.0 in April 2016.
Nice insights on the product, sure something to play with when you get bored of *Atom*.

## Building Reactive Architectures
The talk by [@mattpodwysocki](https://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki) was great, I was skeptical at first, again *Functional reactive programming*, but in the end was a really nice and talk, with all you need to know about RxJs inside.

For @mattpodwysocki async is awful, we are living in a `Callback Hell` era and `Events and state are mess`.
**Promise are only part of solution**.

You can solve the Callback hell in the reactive way!

Keys:
- React to load
- React to failure
- React to users

This man is a great on the stage with his sorcerer hat in the head.

> You must flatMap it

Nice talk to follow in my opinion.

Conclusion: Make Reactive Great Again! Along with a new hat.

## Discover the information within your data with d3.js
Not much to say about it, it was a really entry level talk by Daniela Mogini.

Some insights on how to manipulate DOM, handling Array of data natively in D3js.

The entry slogan was good: `this has nothing to do with jQuery` but it seems a lot like it to me in general.
Don't get me wrong, I know that D3.js it's really powerful but at the end of this talk I haven't feel much of the awesomeness.

## The Evolution of Asynchronous JavaScript
[@cirpo](https://twitter.com/cirpo) gave us another really good talk about async in javascript.

He started with history, how cool callbacks can be and how, if you aren't a lazy developer, you can avoid the feared callback hell.

He Talked about *Promises*, of course, and how they become the official way to provide async in js today.
But *Promises* aren't always the best choice, you don't use them in flow control. You can end up easily with a **Promise Hell** if you don't pay attention.

> **Generators + Promises** for the win.

*Generators*, a new type of function that doesn't have the *run-to-completion* behaviour of the other functions.
They have a *yield* keyword that can pause/restart the flow and you have full control on it.

Unfortunately you have to use libraries to use them but seems like the next javascript, ES7 (ehm ES2016), will ship async / await natively.
You can start playing with it using babel (or typescript).
```
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator

//add it either to .babelrc or package.json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-async-to-generator"]
}

babel a.es6 -o a.js
node a.js
```

> CHOOSE YOUR CONCURRENCY MODEL
 - callbacks
 - promises
 - async/await
 - highland (RxJs, streams)

## (Web?) Components in production
[@olamad313](https://twitter.com/olamad313) is a UX Designer at Amazon Web Services and gave us a great view about how they handle components in their teams across the world. She didn't speak about libraries or polyfill (*Polimer* for example), they don't actually use one apparently because they didn't want to depend on it.

They build their component using plain javascript embracing web components philosophy and then they also build the bridge to connect components with frameworks or libraries teams choose to use (GWT, Angular, and React).

They keep principles like custom elements and style encapsulation from web components and they reached few benefits:
 - Components are easy to grab for new teams.
 - No longer need to review the components final implementation in production.
 - Little effort after a component redesign
 - A sparked community engagement.

## FFTT: A new concept of build tool
[@m_a_s_s_i](https://twitter.com/m_a_s_s_i) talks about his side project, and invite every one (who can understand what is it about) to contribute on it. Basically he's building his own build tool to replace `grunt`, `gulp` or `webpack` (I'm writing only the most famous one).
Unsatisfied with the job those tools are doing @m_a_s_s_i writes his own to accomplish what he really needs: a fast, deterministic, reliable and language agnostic build tool.

The build system meet functional programming, immutable data structures, memoization of functions result, each step is a pure function.
You never mess with the environment, it's just data transformation other data.
The build graph is declarative and functional. Each build step is imperative but inside a *container*, so you don't mess up with system.

It's built with not many lines of javascript but it's totally programming language independent.

It's not ready for production yet but feel free to contribute if you are interested in it!

## Higher Order Components in React
Finally React :-D. Thanks to [@cef62](https://twitter.com/cef62).

After an excursus on React in general, and the component concept in particular we learn how to extend a component using an high order one.

He spoke about mixins (deprecated with ES6 syntax) as well and he gave us a good `HoC vs Mixins` preview:
- Declarative vs Imperative
- Customizable vs Favors inheritance
- Easy to read vs Hard to read
- Enforce encapsulation

He explains *high order function* as functions that accept a function as an argument and return another function.

So HOC are high order functions that, instead, return a component.

## A Class Action
Last talk of the conference by [@unlucio](https://twitter.com/unlucio), a dispute on probably the most controversial feature in ES2016: the `class` keyword.

He called few witnesses for the *dispute*:
  - `miss function`: do we really need a shorthand for manually defining a constructor Function?

  - `the prototype`: If you want to write once and use your code in multiple situation, prototypal inheritance makes this easy.
  - `class`: does she really add something new to the language and will she simplify everybody's life?

*OOP is good for you... at least that what they say*

![OOP is good for you... at least that what they say](http://thinknsmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/butter_is_good_for_you.jpg)

For code segregation choose `modules` over `classes`

I liked the reference to the coffee and sugar:

When coffee is good you don't need sugar, and `class` seems more like aspartame than sugar.
The difference is that aspartame can kill you!

To sum up it was a really nice conclusion for a really nice two days conference in Verona.
I encourage you to have a look at [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/unlucio/a-class-action) that are self explanatory.
