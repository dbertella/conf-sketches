# Forgotten funky functions by Jakob Mattsson @jakobmattsson

Javascript everything is so simple, but it has great things.

## Functional Programming
function => functional
(function, function) => functional

Whenever you have a problem you can solve it with another function.

- `apply`
- `call`
- `arguments`
- `slice`
- `bind`
- ...and clojure

Stateful function, a function that remember its state.

## Meta Programming
- eval
- Function.toString()

## There is no class
- new
- MyConstructor
- MyConstructor.prototype
- no types

### ES6 or coffeescript syntactic sugar
- class
- constructor
- super
- extends

Understanding **Object.create** you might not need anymore es6 syntatic's sugar
Oveloading: solve it with passing function to function.

Object.create CAN be defined. (now is defined ES6?)
