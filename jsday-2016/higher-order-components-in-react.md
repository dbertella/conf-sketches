# Higher Order Components in React | Matteo Ronchi

First of all web was a document

jquery changed the web, it become dinamyc

Angularjs change the approach, directive first attemp to encapsulate a component
Separation of concern in technology

React, took the template and bring it inside the javascript.

## All modern frameworks are component oriented

Everything can be a component, an application is a tree of components
**Component**: Composable, encapsulated, reusable, easy to design
